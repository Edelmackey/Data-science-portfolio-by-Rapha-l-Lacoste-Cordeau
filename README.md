# Data science portfolio by Raphael Lacoste
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and reports I created alone, or with colleagues, for data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## School projects
These are school projects to which I contributed

#### Financial technologies for engineers
1. [Fintech 1](Projects/Fintech_1.ipynb) is a notebook containing multiple analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This project includes the usual descriptive statistics as well as advanced methods to evaluate an ETF's performance: calculation and comparison with the minimal variance portfolio, Brownian arithmetic simulation, linear and ridge regression.
2. [Fintech 2](Projects/Fintech_2.ipynb) is a notebook containing multiple analysis of selected ETFs. The data is processed, then the base statistics are shown. Then multiple models are built and evaluated: Logit, Decision tree, Random Forest and SVM. Once the model is working on a single ETF, it is applied to all the other ETFs and plotted. Then we compare our ETF to the S&P 500.

#### Financial analysis
1. [Analyse financiere industrielle 1](Projects/Analyse_financiere_industrielle_1.pdf) compares 3 tickers : L.TO, MRU.TO and EMP-A.TO.   
It's purpose is to use simple analysis tools such as: financial ratios, data visualisation, optimistic and pessimistic projections over time.
2. [Analyse financiere industrielle 2](Projects/Analyse_financiere_industrielle_2.pdf) uses 3 methods to calculate the stock price of Amazon.  
The purpose of this report is to decide if Amazon's stock price if overvalued.
3. [Analyse financiere industrielle 3](Projects/Analyse_financiere_industrielle_3.pdf) uses multiple methods and tools to evaluate Molson's financial situation.  
This report is a sectoral analysis of the company, most of the plots and data used in it we're acquired via a Bloomberg terminal.
